Here’s a prioritized task list to achieve your goals of a modular, future-proof, and fully editable Storium game state system, separating UI from data and leveraging your database library:

1. Flesh Out the Full Game State TreeView
Expand the tree to show all tables/entities (games, players, characters, scenes, cards, moves, etc.).
Ensure the tree reflects the normalized database structure, not just nested objects.
2. Integrate the Database Library
Load and save all game state data using your database library (not just in-memory JS objects).
Replace hardcoded demo data with data loaded from the database.
Ensure all CRUD operations (add/edit/delete) go through the database API.
3. Separate UI from Data Logic
Move all data manipulation (CRUD, queries, etc.) into a separate data module/service.
UI components should only call this data service, not manipulate data directly.
Make it easy to swap out the UI or the data backend in the future.
4. Modularize the Codebase
Split code into independent modules: UI components, data service, and database adapter.
Use ES modules or another modular system for maintainability.
5. Add Import/Export Functionality
Allow users to import/export the full game state as text (CSV, JSON, or your table format).
Use the database library’s load/save methods for this.
6. CRUD UI for All Tables
Provide editable table/grid views for each entity (not just tree view).
Allow adding, editing, and deleting rows for all tables.
7. Sync UI and Data
Ensure all UI changes are reflected in the database and vice versa.
Add event listeners or reactive bindings as needed.
8. Testing and Validation
Test all CRUD operations and import/export.
Validate data integrity (unique constraints, foreign keys, etc.).
9. Documentation and Future-Proofing
Document the data model, UI structure, and how to extend/replace modules.
Plan for future features (e.g., real-time sync, multi-user editing).
Next Steps Recommendation:

Start with steps 1–3: expand the tree, integrate the database, and separate UI/data.
Once the data flow is modular, add import/export and full CRUD for all tables
